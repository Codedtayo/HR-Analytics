### Project Overview 
HR analytics, involves gathering together, analyzing, and reporting HR data. This dataset contains records of 311 employees from an HR department. It includes detailed information on employee demographics, employment details, performance, and more. It can be used to analyze employee performance, retention, satisfaction, and diversity in hiring.

### Data Source 
Hr Data: the primary dataset used for this analysis is the ``HRDataset_v14`` file, containing detailed information about each employee of the company.

### Tools
- Excel
- Power Query
- PowerBI
  
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the data preparing phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and profiling.
2. Handling the data types.
3. Handling missing values.
4. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the HR data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall resignation trend.
- Top reasons for resignation.
- Gender bias in recruitment.
- Gender pay gap

## Data Analysis

- **Diversity Hiring**: Approximately 9.32% of employees were hired through diversity job fairs.
  
- **Satisfaction and Engagement**:
  - Employees have an average satisfaction rating of 3.89 out of 5.
  - The average engagement survey score is 4.11, suggesting moderate engagement levels.

- **Absenteeism**:
  - On average, employees have been absent 10.24 times.
 
### Recommendations 
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
- Recruitment sources should intensify effort to be more diverse in their recruitment 
- Employees should be encouraged to rotate across department to address the top reason for resignation which is the desire for another position.
- further investigation and analysis for employees unhapiness.
